# Robotic-Arm

Certainly! Our project was a robotic arm built using an Arduino Uno and servo motors. As a team of four, I led the project and presented it to the judges. The robotic arm was designed to mimic human arm movements and was controlled using the Arduino Uno microcontroller. We utilized servo motors to achieve precise and coordinated motions. The project showcased our teamwork, technical skills, and innovation in designing a functional and cost-effective robotic arm using readily available components.
